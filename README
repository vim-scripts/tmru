This plugin allows users to open recently used files. Users can filter 
the file list by typing a pattern. Users can open multiple files at 
once. The list of recently used files is synchronized across multiple 
instances of (g)vim running simultaneously.

By default, tmru will remember 500 files (accessible via the 
:TRecentlyUsedFiles command). The list can be easily filtered (users 
can optionally use fuzzy patterns, which is not enabled by default though).

Files can be groups in sessions:

     - Use named sessions to group files that are frequently edited together
     - Use numbered sessions to open files you edited during one of the latest editing sessions

Files can be marked as "sticky" -- they will never be removed from the list.

Commands:

:TRecentlyUsedFiles ... open one or more recently used file(s)
:TRecentlyUsedFilesEdit ... edit the mru list
